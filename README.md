# agent-tui

Standalone TUI scaffold for building AI coding agent CLIs.

Extracted from the deepagents CLI — full UI with all agent interactions stubbed behind an `AgentProtocol`.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv run agent-tui
```

## Architecture

The TUI communicates with any agent backend through `AgentProtocol` — a Python protocol class that emits typed `AgentEvent` objects. A `StubAgent` is included for development and testing.

See `agent_tui/protocol.py` for the contract.


## Implementation Phases

Phase 1 Summary
Completed
Branch: phase/1-foundation (commits b045582 → 7e3e127)

Files Created

services/deep_agents/__init__.py
services/deep_agents/adapter.py
services/deep_agents/event_translator.py

docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-14-deepagents-integration-architecture.md
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-14-deepagents-integration.md

Files Modified

domain/protocol.py	+5 EventType values, +4 AgentEvent fields
services/adapter.py	+5 new event handlers
entrypoints/main.py	--agent flag (stub/deepagents)
entrypoints/app.py	+5 stub methods for new events
configurator/settings.py	+deepagents_model property
pyproject.toml	+deepagents>=0.5.2, langchain-openai>=0.3.0

Verification
- uv run agent-tui --agent=stub ✓
- uv run agent-tui --agent=deepagents ✓ (TUI launches)
- 44 tests pass

Key Fixes Applied
1. __init__.py lazy loading — was blocking runtime imports
2. DeepAgentsAdapter.from_settings() — was missing class method
3. create_deep_agent() — was incorrectly using deepagents.Agent

Phase 2 Summary
Completed
Branch: phase/2-file-operations (merges into phase/1-foundation)
Goal: File tools (read, write, edit) flow through TUI approval system

Files Modified

services/deep_agents/event_translator.py	+on_chat_model_stream handler, +path normalization
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-14-deepagents-integration-architecture.md	+filesystem backend spec

Key Technical Fixes

1. Event Key Mismatch (event_translator.py)
   LangGraph uses "event" key, not "event_type"
   
2. Tool Name Location (event_translator.py)
   Tool name is at top level in LangGraph events, not in data dict
   
3. Message Chunk Handler (event_translator.py)
   Added _handle_chat_model_stream for DeepAgents message streaming
   
4. Approval Flow Fix (adapter.py)
   Yield TOOL_CALL event FIRST, then wait for approval (prevents deadlock)
   
5. Comparison Fix (adapter.py)
   Fixed: agent_event.type == EventType.TOOL_CALL
   Was: agent_event.type == AgentEvent.type (always False)
   
6. TOOL_RESULT Metadata (event_translator.py)
   Added tool_name and tool_id to tool result events for widget display
   
7. Filesystem Backend (adapter.py)
   Added FilesystemBackend with virtual_mode=True
   /test.txt resolves to <cwd>/test.txt instead of system root
   
8. Path Normalization (event_translator.py)
   Converts /test.txt to test.txt for UI display (user-friendly paths)

Verification
- "Read README.md" → approval widget appears ✓
- Approve → file content displays ✓
- "Create test.txt" → writes to current directory ✓
- All file operations resolve against cwd, not system root ✓
- 44 tests pass

Event Flow
User message → on_chat_model_stream → MESSAGE_CHUNK (thinking)
  → on_tool_start → TOOL_CALL event → Yield event
  → TUI shows ApprovalMenu → User approves → approval_event.set()
  → Stream resumes → Tool executes → on_tool_end
  → TOOL_RESULT event → TUI shows ToolCallMessage with output

Architecture Notes
- Path normalization in translator affects UI display only
- virtual_mode=True in backend affects actual file operations
- Both work together: UI shows relative paths, backend resolves them correctly
